# TODO

- Spawning projectile: the function can be adjusted using a shift in input AKA Taylor shift of the target polynomial for the shifted initial conditions of the target
- Adjust the entities to use the updated architecture of taking scaled derivatives as global components when spawning (Target/ProjectileSpawner + refactor entities themselves to remove the scale derivatives function)
